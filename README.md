# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

A cat vs dog deep learning image classifier using the ResNet18 neural network architecture. Two models were trained to classify images of dogs vs images of cats: one with the non-pretrained ResNet18 and one with the pretrained ResNet18 on the ImageNet dataset.

The dataset is already split into training and validation data sets in the img/ folder. The training data has 250 images for each class (dog or cat), and the validation data has 50 images for each class.

All code and visualizations are in the Jupyter Notebook, but the code was initially run in a Google Colab Notebook to take advantage of the free GPU.
